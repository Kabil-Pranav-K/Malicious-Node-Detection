Enhancing IoT Network Security: Machine Learning Solutions for Securing RPL-Based IoT Networks from Routing Attacks

Routing attacks are the major threat to RPL based networks so this research aims to develop a machine learning model which will identify various routing attacks and even the new form of routing attacks in the RPL networks. Building a machine learning model capable of identifying routing attack threats precisely in networks with RPL support. Using a network traffic dataset to assess the efficacy of the ML models. Showcasing the model’s resistance to various forms of assault. The project’s outcomes reveal that the suggested machine learning model has great potential of identifying routing attacks, since it is highly accurate and resistant to emerging attacks. It improves the overall security of the RPL networks as a result.
